# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
# Titanic Machine Learning Model

This project is a machine learning model built to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using the DecisionTreeClassifier algorithm.

## Overview

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing a large number of passengers and crew. This project aims to analyze passenger data and build a machine learning model to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset available on Kaggle. It contains information about each passenger, including features such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, and whether they survived or not.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-machine-learning.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook `titanic_ml_model.ipynb` to train the machine learning model and make predictions.
2. Modify the notebook as needed to experiment with different features, algorithms, or parameters.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is performing and can help in fine-tuning the model for better results.

## Results

The results of the model predictions are saved in a CSV file named `predictions.csv`. This file contains the passenger IDs and their corresponding predicted survival status (0 for not survived, 1 for survived).
